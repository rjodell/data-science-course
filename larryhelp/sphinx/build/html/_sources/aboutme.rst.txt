About Me
========

Education
---------

I am a senior Pure Mathematics student  at University of Calfornia Santa Cruz.
As well I am pursuing a minor in Statistics.

Academic Interests
------------------

As well as a standard series of course in analysis, algebra, and linear algebra
my particular interests are below.


In the area of Pure Math my areas of interests include the following:

   1. Differential Geometry
   2. Projective and Hyperbolic Geometries
   3. Mathematical Physics
   4. Differential Equations
   

In the subject area of Statistics my interests includ:

   1. Bayesian Hiererachical Modeling
   2. Machine Learning
   3. Nonparametric Statistics
   4. Clinical Trial Research for Health Care and Biotech

My senior seminar series was an exposition of dynamics of Mobius Transformations, i.e.
the Projective Special Linear Group. In the series we looked at the set of linear fractional 
transformations and their dynamics in the complex plain, as well a brief introductory to the highly
more complex setting of polynomial fractional transformation and their dynamics. Some of the nicely 
behaved mappings were demoed in Matlab.

Skills
------

As well as having a solid foundation in mathematics, I am particularly interested in coding pertainting to 
statistical analysis. My main programming languages are computational in nature, I am proficient in R and
Matlab, although my language is R. I love the R community and vast network of open source code that is available
from the community. My favorite packages developed in R are RJags and DAAG, for monte carlo simulations and 
linear/logtistic regression. As well my prefer environment is WIN Bugs, which is not R, but based on R syntax 
and provides a simplistic setting for parallel MCMC simulation.

Miscellaneous
-------------

I have also done private tutoring for several years beginning in high school, particularly in mathematics.
I have tutored a wide range of age groups from elementary to high school students and at the college undergraduate
level. 

I have been playing bass and bass guitar for on going 8 years. I play classical music and particularly 
enjoy playing funk.
